 <h1><strong>Why banning guns in the US will not solve gun violence</strong></h1>
 <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
 <div id="Purpose">
 <h3>Purpose</h3>
 <p>Every day we see reports of gun violence in the United States on the news, but is the news telling the truth or are they leaving important details out? Leftist news networks such as CNN and others love to report on gun violence, but they never report on the truth. Are guns really at fault here or is it the people? Are the guns being used in the shootings legally owned firearms? How many lives are saved each year from guns compared to the lives lost. These are all questions that the liberal media in the United States fails to answer on their broadcast because they know the truth is that guns are not the problem. The point of my investigation is to determine whether or no banning guns In the United States will solve gun violence. As a person who understands how to properly use and care for a firearm whether it’s a handgun, rifle, or shotgun, I understand how dangerous they can be, but I also understand how much good they can do. A perfect example of how the left do not understand guns has just been shown with the firearm ban in Canada. After a mass shooting that was done with an illegally obtained firearm, Trudeau put a massive gun ban out but what he didn’t realize is in that gun ban he also banned a coffee from Canada because it is called the black rifle company. People who want firearms banned do not understand that 99.9%of people who own them use them responsibly and the ones used in mass shootings were bought illegally. </p>
 <p> The purpose of this is to prove that banning guns will not solve the gun violence problem in the United States and it will only make it worse.</p>
 <div id="Why this topic was chosen">
 <h3>Why this topic was chosen</h3>
<p>I chose this topic for many reasons.The first being I am a very big gun rights advocate. Guns have been a part of my life since I was 10 years old and shot my first gun which was an AR-15. Since them I have been taught how to properly use and take care of about 20-30 different firearms. And with this new firearm ban in Canada i want to prove that it doesnt need to happen in America as well. The second being that people seem to be very uneducated when it comes to guns. People want guns banned because they look scary. One big example of a gun that people want banned is the AR-15. People believe the AR in AR-15 stands for assault rifle which is completely wrong it stands for Armalite which is the company who made it. They also think it is fully automatic which is also false, the m4 which is a replica to the AR-15 is fully automatic but its only used in the military the AR-15 is semi automatic. I find it kind of funny and sad that they want a gun banned based off of looks because if you show them an AR-15 and an SKS they will say the AR-15 is the most deadly when the SKS shoots at the same firing rate of the AR-15 but uses a 7.62mm round which is larger than the AR-15 223 or the 5.56mm round that it uses.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>I predict that with my information and my sources the results will show that banning guns will be very inefective and only cause more violence.</p> 

<h2><u>Analysis</u></h2>

<div id="Banning guns will not solve gun violence">
<h3>Banning guns will not solve gun violence</h3>
<p>Banning guns will not solve gun violence. A recent study published in the Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy concluded that there is a negative correlation between gun ownership and violent crime in countries internationally (more guns = less crime). Nations with strict gun control laws have substantially higher murder rates than those who do not in general. In fact, the 9 European nations with the lowest gun ownership rate have a combined murder rate 3x that of the 9 European nations with the highest gun ownership rate! If we check on the United States guns per citizen we can use mean to solve it. There are 393 million people in the United States and there are 328.2 million guns which if you divide 393 million by 328.2 million you get 1.19 guns per person. Now this mesurement is very unaccurate because there are people who own thousands of guns and people who own just a few guns. This shows that there are a lot of guns in the United States.</p>

<p>This statistic shows the weapon types used in mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and February 26, 2020. These calculations are based on 118 mass shooting incidents reported by the source. A total of 55 rifles have been used in 47 mass shootings between 1982 and February 2020. This graph goes to show that guns they want banned which are rifles are not the most commonly used as it is easuer to get a hundgun illegally.
